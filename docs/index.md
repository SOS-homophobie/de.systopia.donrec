# Preface

The described software was developed and published in and under legislative
terms of Germany. The said software is an extension for CiviCRM and may be used
to receipt donations according to tax laws. As taxation is specific for certain
countries, the underlying conventions in this extension have to be specific,
too. Great care has to be applied when using the software in other countries. In
order to facilitate the assessment of possibilities and limitations under
foreign tax laws, this documentation is now also given in english.

The extension in its last stable version ist well tested up to version 4.6.9 of
CiviCRM.

**Urgent Note**: Proper function is only to be assured when working with Firefox web
browser (Mozilla Foundation). This has been tested and verified extensively
under Linux and MS Windows and holds true, although less thoroughly tested,
under Android.
